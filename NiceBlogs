Structure preserving object tracking & Preserving structure in model-free tracking
Language: MATLAB/C++ 
Code: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics-computer-vision-lab/research/research-highlights/structure-preserving-object-tracker/
Highlight: Code can be run directly.
Note: You may not interested in the flower video used in the demo.m. Then you can download other video and annotations from the above link.
Result: you can see some nice result on the link above, but when test on PASCAL VOC baskteball sequence, the all three targets
        are missing after a while.
Speed: 0.27s per frame on PASCAL VOC baskteball.

Multiple Hypothesis Tracking Revisited
Code: http://rehg.org/mht/
Language: MATLAB
Highlight: Result on MOT17 can be seen at https://motchallenge.net/tracker/MHT_DAM_17 . Include result numbers and videos.

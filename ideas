When it's hard to deisgn loss function, e.g, in unsupervised problem, maybe we can input some values by hand as designed loss, 
then let the network learn the proper loss.

When segment images, if we only want some specific objects, for example, persons, can we accelerate the inference process since we do
not need labels on other categories?
